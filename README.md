Classifying Indoor and Outdoor acoustic environment

Using the MLEnd London Sounds dataset, building a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input an audio segment and predicting whether the audio segment has been recorded indoors or outdoors. The problem here is to classify the 7 seconds audio by intrepreting its acoustic environment Indoor or Outdoor.

We will be using Supervised Machine Learning Models by using features from the librosa python package to retrive information.

*What's Intresting about it*

Audio files are complex data types. Specifically they are discrete signals or time series, consisting of values on a temporal window/dimension.This project gives an insight to work with different audio features to classify its environment.

Additionally this project gives an inference of machine learning model that best suits this application. Furthermore, We will explore different methods to choose best hyperparameteters and compares the effectiveness of supervised models for this application.
